This guide introduces Angular, a powerful framework for building scalable applications, and demonstrates how to create a to-do app using Angular features, CI/CD setup with Netlify, and automation with GitHub Actions. It covers key Angular features and best practices for deploying and testing applications efficiently.




Introduction to Angular
In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the world of Angular, a popular JavaScript framework for building scalable and efficient applications. We'll start by introducing Angular, its history, and its features, followed by a hands-on example of building a to-do app.

What is Angular?
Angular is a UI framework built by Google and actively maintained by the Angular team. It has around 30 members working on it, ensuring continuous improvements and updates. Angular is not to be confused with AngularJS, its predecessor, which was created in 2009 and has since reached its end of life.

Framework vs Library
Before we dive deeper into Angular, it's essential to understand the difference between a framework and a library. A framework generally contains a set of libraries, which provide a structure for building applications. In contrast, a library is a specific functionality that can be used to achieve a particular task.

Features of Angular
Angular provides a range of features that make it an attractive choice for building complex applications. Some of its key features include:

Template engine
Data binding
Forms
Routing
Observables
PWAs
Building a To-Do App
Let's create a simple to-do app to demonstrate some of Angular's features in action. We'll use the Angular CLI to generate a new project and then add some tasks to our to-do list. This example will give you a taste of how Angular works and how its features can be used to build a functional application.

Setting up CI/CD with Netlify
In addition to building an application, it's crucial to set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This ensures that our code is automatically built, tested, and deployed to production whenever changes are made. We'll use Netlify to set up a CI/CD pipeline for our to-do app.

Using GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows us to automate tasks and workflows. We'll use GitHub Actions to build our application and run tests on every pull request. This ensures that our code is thoroughly tested before it's merged into the main branch.

Conclusion
In this article, we've introduced Angular, its features, and its benefits. We've also demonstrated how to build a simple to-do app using Angular and set up a CI/CD pipeline with Netlify. Finally, we've explored how GitHub Actions can be used to automate tasks and workflows. With this knowledge, you're ready to start building your own Angular applications and leveraging the power of CI/CD pipelines.
